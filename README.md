123&Me is a platform designed to help younger children learn to read and write numbers, as well as basic numeracy to test understanding. As such, it's benefits are threefold:
- Allows teaching for younger children to be fully autonomous, allowing for easy and accessible teaching, especially given high childcare costs
- Aids in the increasingly important need to move towards a paperless world
- Capitalises on the widespread access to touchscreen devices
- Allows educators to help children gain numerical literacy more quickly.

123&Me is designed to be simple and intuitive, especially for it's younger audience. With fewer, larger buttons and a large canvas on which children can draw, it is easy to understand and use, possibly required only a quick demo from a supervising adult.
There are five buttons:
- Clear: To clear your board
- Check: To check your answer
- Shuffle: To give you a new number to copy, to be used initially by kids
- Add: Provides basic addition
- Subtract: Provides basic subtraction

The frontend is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The backend is written in Django, with numerical analysis being computed by a CNN machine learning model we trained using the MNIST dataset.
